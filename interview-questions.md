# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is when a piece of data goes through another piece of data over and over again until a condition is met.

  Researched answer: When a set of instructions are repeated until a condition is met. When the first set of instructions is executed again it is then called iteration. When a sequence of instructions is executed repeatedly it is called a loop. This definition helped in my clarification between iteration and loop. They were basically the same thing for me initially.


2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map() takes in three parameters; value, index and array. The only one that is required is value.

  Researched answer: .map() takes the current value, the index of that value, and the array the value belongs to. The only one that is required is the current value.


3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring is when you take individual items at an index and unpack them into their own variables.

  Researched answer: An expression that makes it possible to take values from arrays (or properties from objects! I didn't know that!) and put them into distinct variables.


4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: A class is the blueprint for an object. It can contain data and behavior that can then be assigned to an object upon it's inception.

  Researched answer: A class is a template for an object. It defines and objects properties and behavior giving the object a default setting that can be manipulated later on. One great analogy was that the class can be viewed as a "type" and an object as being a "variable".


5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: You use the method super() when creating a child class. Super() will initialize the constructor method that is found in the parent class.

  Researched answer: The super() method calls upon the constructor() method found in the parent class and thus gaining access to all of the parent's properties and methods.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I have no idea, unfortunately, but I am about to find out...

  Researched answer: It is when JavaScript takes a declaration and "puts" it at the top of a block of code. The code doesn't actually change the physical location of the variable or function being declared. JavaScript will just interpret it as being above the block of code. However it only hoists declarations. If a variable is declared and initialized at the bottom of the code block JavaScript will read that there is a variable but it's assignment is returned as undefined. Also let, and const do not get hoisted.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is component based so it takes a bunch of small items or components and then joins them together into one application.

2. React lifecycle methods: The series of events your react component goes through. They are Mounting, Update and Unmount. So you create, grown and then destroy.
Destroy sounds so ominous especially when in relation to coding, but I am assuming I will understand a little more when I see it in action next week.

3. React state: It is an object that is managed within a component. The object will determine how the component renders and behaves.

4. Component invocation/call:

5. DOM Events: It is when a user clicks on an HTML element and executes code within JavaScript. Some examples are a mouse click or when an image loads on a page.
